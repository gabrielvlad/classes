/*
1.4 Constructors
The purpose of this exercise is to see how a thread can receive information through its constructor.
Make a copy of exercise 1, the one which prints numbers and letters. Modify the code so that the
constructor each Runnable class takes a parameter, which determines how many numbers/letters to print
out. Currently itâ€™s hardcoded to 10. You should be able to instantiate the threads similar to this:
Thread numPrint = new Thread(new Numbers(57));
Thread letPrint = new Thread(new Letters(33));
